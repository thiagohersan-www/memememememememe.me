## Ob_ject and Ob_serve (Liverpool, 2016)

![](/assets/posts/exhibitions/small-view.jpg)

This was an exhibition we put together for [A Small View](http://asmallview.co.uk/){:target="_blank"} in Liverpool at the end of 2016, along with other resident researchers at [FACT](http://www.fact.co.uk/){:target="_blank"} ([Alex](http://alexpearl.miriadonline.info/){:target="_blank"} and [Sam](http://samskinner.net/){:target="_blank"}). Given the complex relationships that humans have  with both “natural” systems (as evidenced by global warming), and engineered systems (internet as surveillance), we proposed works that imagined a world without humans, or, at least, a world where the divisions between humans/nonhumans, nature/culture, matter/thought, don’t make as much sense as they used to.
